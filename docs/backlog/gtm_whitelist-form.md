# PRD: Whitelist Form GA4 Event Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing proper Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) event tracking for the whitelist form submission process.

## Problem Statement
Currently, whitelist form submissions are not being properly tracked in Google Analytics, preventing us from measuring conversion rates and user engagement with this critical funnel step.

## Goals
- Implement reliable tracking of whitelist form submissions
- Capture relevant form metadata for analytics segmentation
- Ensure data consistency across all environments
- Enable conversion tracking for marketing attribution

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Data Layer Implementation
- **Requirement**: The data layer must be properly initialized before any events are pushed
- **Implementation**: Modify the `pushToDataLayer` function in `app/whitelist/page.tsx` to initialize the data layer if it doesn't exist
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Data layer initialization check is added to the function

### 2. Event Naming Convention
- **Requirement**: Standardize event naming to ensure proper trigger activation
- **Implementation**: Use `whitelist_submission` as the standard event name
- **Acceptance Criteria**: All code references to this event use consistent naming

### 3. Form Submission Logic
- **Requirement**: Ensure event tracking occurs at the appropriate point in the submission flow
- **Implementation**: 
  - Place data layer push after successful form submission confirmation
  - Add error handling to prevent skipped tracking
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Events are pushed only after successful submissions

### 4. GTM Configuration
- **Requirement**: Proper GTM setup to capture and forward events to GA4
- **Implementation**:
  - Create custom event trigger for `whitelist_submission`
  - Configure GA4 Event tag with appropriate parameters:
    - `conversion_type: whitelist_form`
    - `form_id: {{dataLayer.form_id}}`
- **Acceptance Criteria**: GTM correctly forwards events to GA4

## Testing & Validation
- **Requirement**: Comprehensive testing methodology to ensure proper implementation
- **Implementation**:
  - Use GTM Preview mode during form submission testing
  - Implement console logging for development environments
  - Verify events in GA4 DebugView
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Events appear in GA4 reports with correct parameters

## Success Metrics
- 100% of form submissions tracked in GA4
- Accurate conversion attribution in marketing reports
- Ability to segment users based on form submission data

## Timeline
- Development: 3 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Deployment: 1 day

## Stakeholders
- Marketing Team: Primary consumers of the analytics data
- Development Team: Implementation of tracking code
- Analytics Team: GTM and GA4 configuration
